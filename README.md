# AF 2006-2020. An incomplete Introspective view on the FLOS/CH community

Authors: Julian **Bogdani**, Federico **Sciacca**

This brief presentation aims at throwing a rapid eye on the activity of the FLOS, i.e. Free Libre and Open Source related to Cultural Heritage. The main sources for the data behind the presentation are the publications of the Proceedings of the ArcheFOSS conference. Particular attention is paid to the licensing of the presented applications and to the attempt to recover their life after the presentation.
